# **David Chu's China Bistro Site**

- This Website was created as a capstone project for my *`HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for Web Developers`* course done on Coursera.
- It is an auto-scaled website that includes many functionalities such as drop-down menu and also a dynamic layout for mobile or small screen users.

- Scaling of the website was achieved by creating different layouts for the different space constraints.
- The site is deployed on GitHub which is viewable through the link given below:
